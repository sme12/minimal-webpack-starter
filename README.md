## Very Minimal Webpack Starter For Frontend Project

It was my practice for setting up Webpack, so it's far from perfect.

The project uses some gorgeous libraries:

1. [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
2. [pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug)
4. [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)
5. [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)
6. [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)
7. [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)
8. [stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint)

It also uses [Kraftvaerk](https://github.com/kraftvaerk) configs for [eslint](https://github.com/kraftvaerk/eslint-config-kraftvaerk) and [stylelint](https://github.com/kraftvaerk/stylelint-config-kraftvaerk), cause I work in Kraftvaerk and try to get used to code rules.
